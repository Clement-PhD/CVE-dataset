 Installation
 ============
 
-Python Support
---------------
+.. warning::
+
+    Prior to version 1.3, pip did not use SSL for downloading packages from PyPI, and thus left
+    users more vulnerable to security threats. We advise installing at least version 1.3.
+    If you're using `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org>`_ to install pip, we advise installing
+    at least version 1.9, which contains pip version 1.3.
+
+
+Python & OS Support
+-------------------
 
 pip works with CPython versions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and also pypy.
 
+pip works on Unix/Linux, OS X, and Windows.

 pip can be installed globally in order to manage global packages.
 Often this requires the installation to be performed as root.
 
-Prerequisites
-+++++++++++++
+.. warning::
+
+    We advise against using easy_install to install pip, because easy_install
+    does not download from PyPI over SSL, so the installation might be insecure.
+    Since pip can then be used to install packages (which execute code on
+    your computer), it is better to go through a trusted path.

-A global install of pip requires either `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_
-or `distribute <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_ to be installed globally as well.
+Requirements

-In many cases, these can be installed using your OS package manager.

+If installing pip using a linux package manager, these requirements will be installed for you.
 
 .. warning::
 
     If you are using Python 3.X you **must** use distribute; setuptools doesn't
     support Python 3.X.

 Using get-pip

-Download `get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_
-and execute it using Python.  This will only install pip, not the prerequisites.
