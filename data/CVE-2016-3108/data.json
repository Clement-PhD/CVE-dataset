    "body": "Security researcher Sander Bos contacted the Pulp team to notify us\nthat the pulp-gen-nodes-certificate script suffers from the same\nexploit as was found in CVE-2016-3095, namely that the $TMP\ndirectory that contains the Nodes private key was created in an\nunsafe manner. This commit contains his proposed patch, using\nmktemp -d to safely create the directory.\n\nAdditionally, I added a set -e so that the script would exit upon\nerror.\n\nThanks to Sander Bos for taking the time to carefully inspect the\nPulp codebase and for writing a wonderfully detailed report\ndescribing the issue and the fix for it.\n\nCredit also goes to Jeremy Cline (Red Hat) for independently\nreporting this issue.\n\nhttps://pulp.plan.io/issues/1830\n\nfixes #1830\n",
