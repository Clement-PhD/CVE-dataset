    "body": "Fix for http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/13207\n\nThe public user id in rados gateway is \"anonymous\" defined by RGW_USER_ANON_ID\nDuring a public read of a bucket (for example by generating a public url and accessing it), the method to know whether the user is public or not, the id is being compared with the public user group's uri and not with RGW_USER_ANON_ID. This led to the public user being considered as an authenticated user and hence read of a bucket is working even when the canned acl for the bucket is set to \"authenticated-read\".\nAlso, the bucket_acl  object is always being created of the base type RGWAccessControlPolicy while it should be created based on the dialect of the the request (s3 or swift)\n",
