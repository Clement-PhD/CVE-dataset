+IO Adapters
+-----------
+
+When a file is uploaded or attached, it can be in one of a few different input
+forms, from Rails' UploadedFile object to a StringIO to a Tempfile or even a
+simple String that is a URL that points to an image.
+
+Paperclip will accept, by default, many of these sources. It also is capable of
+handling even more with a little configuration. The IO Adapters that handle
+images from non-local sources are not enabled by default. They can be enabled by
+adding a line similar to the following into `config/initializers/paperclip.rb`:
+
+```ruby
+Paperclip::DataUriAdapter.register
+```
+
+It's best to only enable a remote-loading adapter if you need it. Otherwise
+there's a chance that someone can gain insight into your internal network
+structure using it as a vector.
+
+The following adapters are *not* loaded by default:
+
+* `Paperclip::UriAdapter` - which accepts a `URI` instance.
+* `Paperclip::HttpUrlProxyAdapter` - which accepts a `http` string.
+* `Paperclip::DataUriAdapter` - which accepts a Base64-encoded `data:` string.
