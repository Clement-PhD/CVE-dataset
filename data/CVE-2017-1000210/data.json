    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI fixed the stack overflow in the function **pico_dns_decompress_name**.\r\n\r\nIn this function we had a buffer with a size of 256 bytes which is being filled inside a while loop.\r\nThe problem is that the break condition of this loop stops the loop only when reaching to a null terminator byte. An attacker can cause a stack overflow and possibly run an arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted packet.\r\n\r\nAlso, the functions **pico_mdns_handle_data_as_answers_generic** and **pico_mdns_handle_single_question** would have crashed if pico_dns_decompress_name returns NULL instead of an allocated buffer so I added a fix to them too.",
