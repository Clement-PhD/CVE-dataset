 ==== Marshalling data
 The Hot Rod client allows one to plug in a custom marshaller for transforming user objects into byte arrays and the other way around. This transformation is needed because of Hot Rod's binary nature - it doesn't know about objects.
 
+.WARNING: If developing your own custom marshaller, take care of potential injection attacks.
+To avoid such attacks, make the marshaller verify that any class names read, before instantiating it, is amongst the expected/allowed class names.
+
 The marshaller can be plugged through the "marshaller" configuration element (see Configuration section): the value should be the fully qualified name of a class implementing the link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/marshall/Marshaller.html[Marshaller] interface. This is a optional parameter, if not specified it defaults to the link:{javadocroot}/org/infinispan/marshall/jboss/GenericJBossMarshaller.html[GenericJBossMarshaller] - a highly optimized implementation based on the link:http://www.jboss.org/jbossmarshalling[JBoss Marshalling] library.
 
 Since version 6.0, there's a new marshaller available to Java Hot Rod clients based on Protostream which generates portable payloads. You can find more information about it <<_querying_via_the_java_hot_rod_client,here>>
