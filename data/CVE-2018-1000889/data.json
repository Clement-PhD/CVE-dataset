    "body": "This prevents issues with XXE (XML external entity) processing,\r\nparticularly for untrusted circuit files. This is potentially dangerous,\r\nsince it lets an attacker with a crafted circuit file to read files from\r\na user's system. I have verified that it is possible to create a circuit\r\nfile which does this. With this patch, an error message is displayed\r\ninstead of XXE occurring.\r\n\r\nSome examples of XXE are available on [on OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing).\r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't make any breaking changes with existing circuit\r\nfiles, it only prevents loading malicious circuit files.",
