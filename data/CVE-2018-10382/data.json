    "body": "### What does it do?\r\nApplies htmlspecialchars to some processors which were exposing 3 stored XSS issues. \r\n\r\n### Why is it needed?\r\nTighten security a bit. \r\n\r\nNone of these XSS issues should have any far-reaching consequences. They all require manager access for starters. Also\r\n\r\n- The one in the recently edited dashboard widget would only be useful to XSS yourself, as the resource list only shows resources you personally edited. Perhaps a problem when sharing user accounts. \r\n- Access to edit the top menu (actions) is needed for number 2. That's an advanced permission that only full admins should have.\r\n- Adding/editing setting permission is needed for number 3. Also, that should already be limited to full admin users.\r\n\r\n### Related issue(s)/PR(s)\r\nSecurity inbox ticket number 69. Reported by Aman Sahey on April 25th.",
