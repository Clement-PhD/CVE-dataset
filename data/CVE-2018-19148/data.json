    "body": "**Please help test and review this PR!**\r\n\r\n### 1. What does this change do, exactly?\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are internal to the code, but there are bug fixes and a couple minor breaking changes for server type plugins that use the `caddytls` package.\r\n\r\n- Expose the list of Caddy instances through caddy.Instances()\r\n\r\n- Added arbitrary storage to caddy.Instance\r\n\r\n- The cache of loaded certificates is no longer global; now scoped\r\n  per-instance, meaning upon reload (like SIGUSR1) the old cert cache\r\n  will be discarded entirely, whereas before, aggressively reloading\r\n  config that added and removed lots of sites would cause unnecessary\r\n  build-up in the cache over time.\r\n\r\n- Key certificates in the cache by their SHA-256 hash instead of\r\n  by their names. This means certificates will not be duplicated in\r\n  memory (within each instance), making Caddy much more memory-efficient\r\n  for large-scale deployments with thousands of sites sharing certs.\r\n\r\n- Perform name-to-certificate lookups scoped per caddytls.Config instead\r\n  of a single global lookup. This prevents certificates from stepping on\r\n  each other when they overlap in their names.\r\n\r\n- Do not allow TLS configurations keyed by the same hostname to be\r\n  different; this now throws an error.\r\n\r\n- Updated relevant tests, with a stark awareness that more tests are\r\n  needed.\r\n\r\n- Change the NewContext function signature to include an *Instance.\r\n\r\n- Strongly recommend (basically require) use of caddytls.NewConfig()\r\n  to create a new *caddytls.Config, to ensure pointers to the instance\r\n  certificate cache are initialized properly.\r\n\r\n- Update the TLS-SNI challenge solver (even though TLS-SNI is disabled\r\n  currently on the CA side). Store temporary challenge cert in instance\r\n  cache, but do so directly by the ACME challenge name, not the hash.\r\n  Modified the getCertificate function to check the cache directly for\r\n  a name match if one isn't found otherwise. This will allow any\r\n  caddytls.Config to be able to help solve a TLS-SNI challenge, with one\r\n  extra side-effect that might actually be kind of interesting (and\r\n  useless): clients could send a certificate's hash as the SNI and\r\n  Caddy would be able to serve that certificate for the handshake.\r\n\r\n- Do not attempt to match a \"default\" (random) certificate when SNI\r\n  is present but unrecognized; return no certificate so a TLS alert\r\n  happens instead.\r\n\r\n- Store an Instance in the list of instances even while the instance\r\n  is still starting up (this allows access to the cert cache for\r\n  performing renewals at startup, etc). Will be removed from list again\r\n  if instance startup fails.\r\n\r\n- Laid groundwork for ACMEv2 and Let's Encrypt wildcard support.\r\n\r\nServer type plugins will need to be updated slightly to accommodate\r\nminor adjustments to their API (like passing in an Instance). This\r\ncommit includes the changes for the HTTP server.\r\n\r\nCertain Caddyfile configurations might error out with this change, if\r\nthey configured different TLS settings for the same hostname.\r\n\r\nThis change trades some complexity for other complexity, but ultimately\r\nthis new complexity is more correct and robust than earlier logic.\r\n\r\n### 2. Please link to the relevant issues.\r\n\r\nFixes #1991\r\nFixes #1994\r\nFixes #1303 \r\n\r\n### 3. Which documentation changes (if any) need to be made because of this PR?\r\n\r\nThe `tls` directive page will definitely need updating. TLS configurations for equal hostnames cannot be different. Any description about how certificates are stored internally might need to change.\r\n\r\nOH, and something I forgot on the original commit message: Caddy can now better support being used in conjunction with other Caddy instances that share the same certificate storage. In other words, if you have multiple instances all using the same $CADDYPATH, that's been a bad idea because they will all try to manage the certificates themselves (keep them renewed, etc, which runs you into rate limits fast). Now, Caddy will attempt to check if the certificate in storage still needs to be renewed just before it fires off a renewal. So if you stagger Caddy deployments by more time than it takes to complete an ACME challenge (usually just a few seconds, but if you use DNS challenge maybe minutes or more), they might play better together in an acceptable way, for small-medium scale use cases. I wouldn't rely on this for high-volume deployments (like, hundreds or thousands of instances sharing the same certificate storage and all trying to manage them) but I bet it'll be better for dozens of Caddy instances!\r\n\r\n** **UPDATE** **: The latest changes I pushed to this branch now eliminate the need to stagger the timing of running each Caddy instance. If multiple Caddy instances (even thousands) share the same certificate storage on disk, they will coordinate renewals and not step on each others' toes. It just requires using the DNS challenge when behind a load balancer. However, testing this is a little tricky, so we'll have to see how it goes. It's an advanced use case, so I'm not expecting many people to be benefitted by it, but I hope they will let us know how it goes!\r\n\r\n### 4. Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have written tests and verified that they fail without my change\r\n- [x] I have squashed any insignificant commits\r\n- [x] This change has comments for package types, values, functions, and non-obvious lines of code\r\n- [x] I am willing to help maintain this change if there are issues with it later\r\n\r\n/cc @pieterlouw and @miekg -- I'll be getting in touch with you soon with more details for what this means about your server type plugins. I can probably submit a PR to caddy-net, and I'm not sure that CoreDNS will have to change much except a line where `NewContext()` is invoked.",
