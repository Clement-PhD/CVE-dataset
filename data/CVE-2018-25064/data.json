    "body": "Issue #56 requested that nodes should also be displayed. The suggested changes in this pull request add this functionality by placing a marker for nodes that have been created, modified or deleted if the node has any tags.\r\nSince this requires that tags are also part of the data structure that is provided by [`osm-stream`](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-stream), it currently has no visible effect though, since tag parsing for nodes only becomes available if/when osmlab/osm-stream#13 (or something similar) gets merged, which currently has a syntax error that could be fixed by applying a trivial patch like the one in mstock/osm-stream@56bf6bd5158ade7eb0fad83d48c746156e4e833e. Once that pull request is merged, somebody would have to cut a release of [`osm-stream`](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-stream) and then the corresponding dependency in [`show-me-the-way`](https://github.com/osmlab/show-me-the-way) would need updating.\r\nThe first five commits in this pull request are mainly smaller code cleanups and fixes - I can extract them to a different branch and create a separate pull request or even drop them if you prefer.\r\nFor demonstration purposes, I've deployed a build with the node feature that uses a patched version of [`osm-stream`](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-stream) [on my Github page](https://mstock.github.io/show-me-the-way/).",
