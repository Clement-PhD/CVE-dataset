    "body": "This fixes a few places where data was not being escaped in the API, and also handles what appears to be a bug in Select2 (that was first reported in 2016, but has not been addressed). \r\n\r\nBecause we use rich menus (images, etc) in our dropdowns, we use the HTML template feature of Select2. While the data we send to Select2 was properly escaped, a bug in Select2 takes that escaped data and parses the HTML in the DOM when the \"selected\" method fires. \r\n\r\nThis vulnerability in Select2 is likely reproducible in any implementation of Select2 where the application is using remote data loading via ajax and also using HTML templates to display the listbox data. We've mitigated it in our specific implementation, and have reached out to Select2 to see if there's been any progress on patching the Select2 library itself. ",
