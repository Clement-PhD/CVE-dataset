    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of Former is to use $_GET variables to populate the form fields, If I understood correctly.\r\n\r\nThis makes a XSS attack possible because checkbox are not escaping their values.\r\n\r\nA similar fix was made here in 2014 for hidden inputs: https://github.com/formers/former/commit/58596440993dd09e77724e24afdbb229e227946b\r\n\r\nI had a hard time trying to use the right version for the tests, since there's no composer.lock, but when I got it right all tests passed.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Create new Laravel app\r\n* Install Former through Composer\r\n* Add code to welcome.blade.php: \r\n`{!! Former::checkbox('test') !!}`\r\n* run php artisan serve\r\n* Open URL: \r\n```\r\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/?test=\"><h1><i>some HTML here</i></h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior:\r\n\r\n* Value would be escaped/encoded, no HTML would be rendered\r\n\r\n## What happens:\r\n\r\n* HTML is displayed (XSS attack)\r\n\r\n",
