    "body": "Here's a sad story:\n\n* 70971457 is merged into shadow, allowing newgidmap/newuidmap to be\ninstalled with file caps rather than setuid.\n* https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/63248 is filed to take advantage of\nthis.\n* The arch maintainer of the 'shadow' package notices that this doesn't\nwork, and submits a pull request to fix this in shadow.\n* edf7547ad5 is merged, fixing the post install hooks.\n\nThe problem here is that distros have been building shadow with PAM for\nO(years), but the install hooks have silently failed due to the\ncombination of the directory mismatch (suidubins vs suidsbins) and later\nsuccess with setuid'ing newgidmap/newuidmap.\n\nWith the install hooks fixed, those of us (Arch[1] and Gentoo[2] so far)\nwho never built shadow explicitly with --enable-account-tools-setuid are\nnow getting setuid account tools, and don't have PAM configuration\nsuitable for use with setuid account management tools.\n\nIt's entirely unclear to me why you'd want this, but I assume there's\nsome reason out there for it existing. Regardless, setuid binaries are\ndangerous and shouldn't be enabled by default without good reason.\n\n[1] https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/64836\n[2] https://bugs.gentoo.org/702252",
