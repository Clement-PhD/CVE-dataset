+# Falco uses a shared buffer between the kernel and userspace to pass

+# full and system calls have been dropped, it can take one or more of
+# the following actions:
+#   - "ignore": do nothing. If an empty list is provided, ignore is assumed.
+#   - "log": log a CRITICAL message noting that the buffer was full.
+#   - "alert": emit a falco alert noting that the buffer was full.
+#   - "exit": exit falco with a non-zero rc.

+# The rate at which log/alert messages are emitted is governed by a
