    "body": "Our team at @AliasRobotics identified and reported in RVD#2401 the use of \r\nunsafe yaml load (https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/2401).\r\n\r\nAfter triaging the flaw we detected that it was  exploitable and could lead to \r\nlocal (or remote, based on certain common user interaction) code execution.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the flaw itself is caused by an unsafe parsing of YAML values which \r\nhappens whenever an action message is processed to be sent, and allows for the \r\ncreation of Python objects. Through this flaw in ROS, an attacker could build a \r\nmalicious payload and execute arbitrary code in Python. A PoC is available but \r\nhave decided not to disclose it for now and until this is mitigated and debs are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nPeer-researched and coded with @ibaiape.",
