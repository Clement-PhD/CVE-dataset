    "body": "Previously, the queue buffer was initialized using `Vec::from_iter` through `collect`. Note that `collect` does not guarantee a precise capacity; the layout of the allocated memory could have a greater size.\r\n\r\n`ArrayVec::drop` assumed the buffer has a size equal to the queue's capacity. This is undefined behavior when the buffer actually has a different size thanks to `Vec`.\r\n\r\nUsing `Box<[T]>` instead guarantees an exact capacity, resolving the UB.\r\n\r\n(The same fix should probably be applied to [`concurrent-queue`](https://github.com/stjepang/concurrent-queue) as it suffers from the same bug.)",
