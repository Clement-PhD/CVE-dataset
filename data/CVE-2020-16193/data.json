    "body": "This addresses a vulnerability reported by @heinhtetaung where Internal Note contents are not correctly sanitized if errors are returned. This adds `true` as the second argument to `Format::htmlchars()` so that all content is sanitized properly. In some cases however we cannot blanket sanitize all the content as Inline Images, etc. tend to get obfuscated. So in those cases this adds `Format::sanitize()` to the Internal Notes directly.\r\n\r\nThis addresses an issue where we are not sanitizing the Internal Notes when adding a new Banlist item. This adds a check for `$extra['notes']` and if exists we will sanitize the content before it is saved. This will ensure no malicious content is saved in the database.\r\n\r\nThis mitigates an SSRF security vulnerability reported by [Talat Mehmood](https://twitter.com/Blackbatsecuri1) where we do not check if the src URL for external inline images contain a valid image extension when displaying. This means if someone puts something like `<img src=\"mymalicioussite.com/badscript.js\">` in the body of their message, when someone clicks Show Images or when the ticket is printed the server will call the src URL to get the \"image\" data for display. This is a problem as this could load malicious code/scripts in the browser. This adds a new setting called `Allow External Images` and if Disabled we will not allow any external images in Threads. If this setting is Enabled (default), we will only allow `<img>` src URLs with valid image extensions (`png`,`jpg`,`jpeg`,`gif`).\r\n\r\nThis mitigates an XSS vulnerability reported by [The NAVEX Project](https://sisl.lab.uic.edu/projects/chess/) where if an attachment is uploaded via Draft AJAX, the filename stored/returned in the response is not sanitized. This updates `DraftAjaxAPI::_uploadInlineImage()` to sanitize the filename before it's returned in the JSON encoded response. This also updates `AttachmentFile::format()` to sanitize the filename before saving to the backend. In addition this forces the `application/json` Content-Type on all AJAX responses that return strictly JSON; this adds another layer of protection.",
