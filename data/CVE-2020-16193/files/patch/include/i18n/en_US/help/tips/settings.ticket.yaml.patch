+        If Enabled, the system will allow external inline images that have a valid image
+        extension (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif). If Disabled, the system will exclude
+        any external inline images. One caveat to note, is if the setting is Disabled we

+        the setting is re-enabled in the future.
