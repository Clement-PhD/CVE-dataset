+Expedited Deprecation: Removal of the params module option in ``ldap_attr`` and ``ldap_entry``
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The ``params`` module option in ``ldap_attr`` and ``ldap_entry`` are deprecated on a short cycle (to
+be removed in Ansible-2.10) due to circumventing Ansible's normal option handling.  In particular,
+if the ``bind_pw`` option is set with ``params``, the value of the option could end up being placed
+in a logfile or displayed on stdout.

 Noteworthy module changes
 -------------------------
 
+* **Security Issue** Setting ``bind_pw`` with the ``params`` option for the ``ldap_entry`` and
+  ``ldap_attr`` modules has been disallowed.  If ``bind_pw`` was set with ``params``, the value
+  could have ended up in a logfile or displayed on stdout.  Set ``bind_pw`` directly, with the
+  modules' options instead.

 * Check mode is now supported in the ``command`` and ``shell`` modules. However, only when ``creates`` or ``removes`` is
   specified. If either of these are specified, the module will check for existence of the file and report the correct
   changed status, if they are not included the module will skip like it had done previously.
