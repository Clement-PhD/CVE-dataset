 -------------------------
 
+* **Security Issue** Setting ``bind_pw`` with the ``params`` option for the ``ldap_entry`` and
+  ``ldap_attr`` modules has been disallowed.  If ``bind_pw`` was set with ``params``, the value could
+  have ended up in a logfile or displayed on stdout.  Set ``bind_pw`` directly, with the modules'
+  options instead.
 * :ref:`vmware_cluster <vmware_cluster_module>` was refactored for easier maintenance/bugfixes. Use the three new, specialized modules to configure clusters. Configure DRS with :ref:`vmware_cluster_drs <vmware_cluster_drs_module>`, HA with :ref:`vmware_cluster_ha <vmware_cluster_ha_module>` and vSAN with :ref:`vmware_cluster_vsan <vmware_cluster_vsan_module>`.
 * :ref:`vmware_dvswitch <vmware_dvswitch_module>` accepts ``folder`` parameter to place dvswitch in user defined folder. This option makes ``datacenter`` as an optional parameter.
 * :ref:`vmware_datastore_cluster <vmware_datastore_cluster_module>` accepts ``folder`` parameter to place datastore cluster in user defined folder. This option makes ``datacenter`` as an optional parameter.
