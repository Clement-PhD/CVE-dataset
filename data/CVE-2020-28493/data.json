    "body": "Match leading and trailing punctuation as separate steps. For trailing punctuation, perform a basic check first to reduce backtracking. Update the email regex to reduce backtracking and also be more accurate: the domain part must start with a word character, and the tld only matches word characters.\r\n\r\nThis is backported from #1195, but only includes the regex speedups, not the other changes.\r\n\r\nChecklist:\r\n\r\n- ~Add tests that demonstrate the correct behavior of the change. Tests should fail without the change.~\r\n- ~Add or update relevant docs, in the docs folder and in code.~\r\n- [x] Add an entry in `CHANGES.rst` summarizing the change and linking to the issue.\r\n- ~Add `.. versionchanged::` entries in any relevant code docs.~\r\n- [x] Run `pre-commit` hooks and fix any issues.\r\n- [x] Run `pytest` and `tox`, no tests failed.\r\n",
