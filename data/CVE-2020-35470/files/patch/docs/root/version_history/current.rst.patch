 * http: reject requests with missing required headers after filter chain processing.
 * http: sending CONNECT_ERROR for HTTP/2 where appropriate during CONNECT requests.
 * proxy_proto: fixed a bug where the wrong downstream address got sent to upstream connections.
+* proxy_proto: fixed a bug where network filters would not have the correct downstreamRemoteAddress() when accessed from the StreamInfo. This could result in incorrect enforcement of RBAC rules in the RBAC network filter (but not in the RBAC HTTP filter), or incorrect access log addresses from tcp_proxy.
 * tls: fix detection of the upstream connection close event.
 * tls: fix read resumption after triggering buffer high-watermark and all remaining request/response bytes are stored in the SSL connection's internal buffers.
 * watchdog: touch the watchdog before most event loop operations to avoid misses when handling bursts of callbacks.
