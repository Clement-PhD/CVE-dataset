Mik317 has been awarded $25 for fixing the vulnerability through the huntr bug bounty program \ud83d\udcb5. Think you could fix a vulnerability like this?\n           \nGet involved at https://huntr.dev/\n\nQ | A\nVersion Affected | ALL\nBug Fix | YES\nOriginal Pull Request | https://github.com/418sec/httpster/pull/1\nVulnerability README | https://github.com/418sec/huntr/blob/master/bounties/npm/httpster/1/README.md\n\n### User Comments:\n\n### \ud83d\udcca Metadata *\r\n\r\n#### Bounty URL: https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-httpster\r\n\r\n### \u2699\ufe0f Description *\r\n\r\nThe `httpster` file server was vulnerable against a `path traversal` issue which existed because `symlinks` were fetched and their content served without any warn/error.\r\n \r\n### \ud83d\udcbb Technical Description *\r\n\r\nI inserted a `new router` inside the `express` server which was created by `httpster` and used `fs.lstat` to check if the requested file is or not a `symlink`.\r\nIn case it is and the `--symlink` flag isn't specified by the server (default `false` like in other servers like `Nginx`), an error is thrown.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1b Proof of Concept (PoC) *\r\n\r\n1. Download `httpster`\r\n2. `ln -s /etc/passwd test`\r\n3. `httpster`\r\n4. Go on http://localhost:3333/test and the content of the `/etc/passwd` file is shown\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-08-25 17-23-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204053-d6082e80-e703-11ea-81b8-fb1cfe0a8dee.png)\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd25 Proof of Fix (PoF) *\r\n\r\n1. Same steps above, but an error is given instead of the content of the `/etc/passwd` file\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-08-25 18-34-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204133-e5877780-e703-11ea-8264-006b1b65e227.png)\r\n\r\n1. Same steps but start the server with `httpster --symlink` and the `/etc/passwd` file is shown (option)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-08-25 18-35-29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33063403/91204158-eb7d5880-e703-11ea-9bdc-7caa88723097.png)\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc4d User Acceptance Testing (UAT)\r\n\r\nAll ok :smile:",
