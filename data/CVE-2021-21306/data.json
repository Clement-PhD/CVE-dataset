    "body": "## Description\r\n\r\n- Fixes #1860, Fixes #1811 \r\n- Also fixes Commonmark/GFM examples: \r\n  - (em & strong) 361, 387, 388, 407, 412, 415, 416, 424, 425, 442, 445, 446, 453, 455, 456, 457, 465, 466, 467, 470\r\n  - This puts us up to 100% compatibility with commonmark specs!\r\n\r\n- Noticeable speedup, especially on the GFM benchmark (~8.7 sec -> ~8.1 sec, pretty consistent over 5 runs on my laptop)\r\n\r\n## What was attempted\r\n\r\n1) Simplify regex for em & strong, combined now into a single tokenizer\r\n2) When masking the `src` string in Lexer, also mask out escaped `\\*` and `\\_` which further simplifies a lot of regex\r\n3) Track total opening delimiter characters vs closing characters, and ensure they match\r\n4) More closely follow CommonMark spec:\r\n   * Favor `<em><strong>text</strong></em>` over `<strong><em>text</em></strong>`\r\n   * Correct some of the \"New\" spec tests that had this ^ swapped incorrectly (and delete one that is redundant now)\r\n   * Handle em/strong CommonMark [rules 9-10](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/#can-open-emphasis), that left and right delimiters cannot sum to a multiple of 3, unless each is a multiple of 3\r\n   * Handle cases with lots of extra unmatched delimiters, e.g. `*text*********`\r\n\r\nNote this involves significant changes in the Lexer and Tokenizer APIs, which should be noted in the update.\r\n\r\nThe new Regex should be pretty benign compared to the earlier stuff. It literally checks for sequences of the pattern `a***b`, that is, runs of `*` or `_` between a single character on each side.\r\n\r\n## Contributor\r\n\r\n- [x] Test(s) exist to ensure functionality and minimize regression (if no tests added, list tests covering this PR); or,\r\n- [x] no tests required for this PR.\r\n- [ ] If submitting new feature, it has been documented in the appropriate places.\r\n\r\n## Committer\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this should be a different person than the contributor.\r\n\r\n- [ ] CI is green (no forced merge required).\r\n- [ ] Squash and Merge PR following [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).\r\n",
