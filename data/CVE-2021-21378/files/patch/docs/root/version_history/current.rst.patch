 * grpc_http_bridge: the downstream HTTP status is now correctly set for trailers-only responses from the upstream.
 * http: disallowing "host:" in request_headers_to_add for behavioral consistency with rejecting :authority header. This behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting `envoy.reloadable_features.treat_host_like_authority` to false.
 * http: reverting a behavioral change where upstream connect timeouts were temporarily treated differently from other connection failures. The change back to the original behavior can be temporarily reverted by setting `envoy.reloadable_features.treat_upstream_connect_timeout_as_connect_failure` to false.
+* jwt_authn: reject requests with a proper error if JWT has the wrong issuer when allow_missing is used. Before this change, the requests are accepted.
 * listener: prevent crashing when an unknown listener config proto is received and debug logging is enabled.
 * overload: fix a bug that can cause use-after-free when one scaled timer disables another one with the same duration.
 * sni: as the server name in sni should be case-insensitive, envoy will convert the server name as lower case first before any other process inside envoy.
