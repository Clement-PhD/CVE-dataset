+Notable changes in Python 3.8.8
+===============================
+
+Earlier Python versions allowed using both ";" and "&" as
+query parameter separators in :func:`urllib.parse.parse_qs` and
+:func:`urllib.parse.parse_qsl`.  Due to security concerns, and to conform with
+newer W3C recommendations, this has been changed to allow only a single
+separator key, with "&" as the default.  This change also affects
+:func:`cgi.parse` and :func:`cgi.parse_multipart` as they use the affected
+functions internally. For more details, please see their respective
+documentation.
