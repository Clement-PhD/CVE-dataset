-## Security Vulnerability prior to v2.1.0
-
-There is a security vulnerability in versions prior to v2.1.0 in which an unscrupulous actor may execute arbitrary code. If your code sends un-sanitized user input to `json-ptr`'s `.get()` method, your project is vulnerable to this injection-style vulnerability.

-If your code is vulnerable, you should upgrade immediately, and also, stop sending un-sanitized user input to `json-ptr`.

 ## Install
 
 ```bash
 npm install json-ptr
 ```
 
+## Release Bundles
+
+As of v3.0.0, we provide CJS, ESM, and UMD builds under the `dist/` folder when you install the package from NPM, we also have all appropriate references in our `package.json` file, so your code should just work. If you need a CDN reference to `json-ptr`, try [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/), which picks up our releases automatically.
+
 ## Use
 
-### [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

+## Security Vulnerabilities (Resolved)
+
+- **prior to v3.0.0** there was a security vulnerability which allowed a developer to perform prototype pollution by sending malformed path segments to `json-ptr`. If you were one of these developers, you should upgrade to v3.0.0 immediately, and stop using `json-ptr` to pollute an object's prototype. If you feel you have a legitimate reason to do so, please use another method and leave `json-ptr` out of it. Such behavior has been disallowed since it can easily be done using plain ol javascript by those determined to violate common best practice.
+
+- **prior to v2.1.0** there was a security vulnerability which allowed an unscrupulous actor to execute arbitrary code if developers failed to sanitize user input before sending it to `json-ptr`. If your code does not sanitize user input before sending it to `json-ptr`, your project is vulnerable and you should upgrade to v3.0.0 immediately. And while your at it, start sanitized user input before sending it to any library!

+As was rightly pointed out in [this issue](https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/issues/24), I should have rolled the major version at `v1.3.0` instead of the minor version due to [breaking changes to the API](#user-content-where-did-the-global-functions-go).

 ### Where did the Global Functions Go?
 
 In version `v1.3.0` of the library, global functions were moved to static functions of the `JsonPointer` class. There should be no difference in arguments or behavior. If you were previously importing the global functions it is a small change to destructure them and have compatible code.

+- 2021-10-26 — **3.0.0** **Potential Security Vulnerability Patched**
+  - When setting a value on an object graph, a developer could purposely use `json-ptr` to pollute an object's prototype by passing invalid path segments to the set/unset operations. This behavior has been disallowed.
 - 2021-05-14 — **2.2.0** _Added Handling for Relative JSON Pointers_
   - [Example usage](https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/blob/487182100a08f4ddc7713e42ec063bbd5ce2c34c/examples/relative.js)
 - 2021-05-12 — **2.1.1** _Bug fix for [#36](https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/issues/36)_
   - @CarolynWebster reported an unintentional behavior change starting at v1.3.0. An operation involving a pointer/path that crossed a null value in the object graph resulted in an exception. In versions prior to v1.3.0 it returned `undefined` as intended. The original behavior has been restored.
 - 2021-05-12 — **2.1.0** _Bug fixes for [#28](https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/issues/28) and [#30](https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/issues/30); **Security Vulnerability Patched**_
-  - When compiling the accessors for quickly points in an object graph, the `.get()` method was not properly delimiting single quotes. This error caused the get operation to throw an exception in during normal usage. Worse, in cases where malicious user input was sent directly to `json-ptr`, the failure to delimit single quotes allowed the execution of arbitrary code (an injection attack). The first of these issues was reported in #28 by @mprast, the second (vulnerability) by @zpbrent. Thanks also to @elimumford for the actual code used for the fix.

 - 2020-10-21 — **2.0.0** _*Breaking Change*_
   - Prototype pollution using this library is now disallowed and will throw an error. I've been looking into the origin of this issue and it seems to have been disclosed by mohan on [huntr.dev](https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-json-ptr/). I received [a PR from](https://github.com/flitbit/json-ptr/pull/26) [@luci-m-666](https://github.com/luci-m-666), but found [another PR](https://github.com/418sec/json-ptr/pull/1) by [@alromh87](https://github.com/alromh87) that looks like the origin of the solution. Don't know who to thank, but thanks all -- somebody is due a bounty.
   - Just in case somebody was relying on `json-ptr` to support pointers across the prototype, I'm rolling the major version number because you're now broken.
