    "body": "The PR fixes 2 Vulnerabilities found in Crow.\r\n1. A Path Traversal exploit made possible by Crow's default `static` directory and Mustache's `templates` directory.\r\n2. A Content Injection exploit made possible by Crow's Mustache implementation not escaping some characters.\r\n\r\nOnce merged, This PR, along with #292, #296, and #304 Will be released immediately as part of `v0.3+4`.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR introduces a slowdown between `50\u00b5s` and `1.5ms` for any static file or template being loaded (depending on the length of the filename). Therefore I would advise optimization of the `sanitize_filename()` function before the next minor/major release.\r\n\r\nA special Thank you to the [Snyk Security team](https://snyk.io) for their effort in identifying and reporting these vulnerabilities.",
