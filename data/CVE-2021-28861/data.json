    "body": "Due to no protection against multiple (/) at the beginning of a url an attacker could achieve an open redirection by crafting a malformed URI followed by an existing directory.\r\n\r\nPayload: `http://127.0.0.1:8000//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory`\r\n\r\nThe main reason behind open redirection is that there's no (/) at the end of `anyexistingdirectory` because the server is checking for the path supplied is a valid directory at `send_head()` method from [Lib/http/server.py](https://github.com/hamzaavvan/cpython/blob/master/Lib/http/server.py#L683).  Right after that, it's checking for the path ending with a (/) or not. So, if there's no (/) at the end of the path then the server will issue a Location header to redirect the web client to that specific directory.\r\n\r\nWhile issuing the redirection, this part `//attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory` will be sent to the Location header's value due to which any web client or browser will consider it as a new url because of multiple (/) at the beginning of the path.\r\n\r\nSo to mitigate this issue I decided to use regex to replace all the occurrences of (/) from the beginning of the path.\r\n```python\r\n self.path = re.sub(r'(^(/|\\\\)+)', '/', self.path)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis regex will replace multiple entries (if present) of (/) or (\\\\) from the beginning of the path. So that the path would be:\r\n\r\n1. //attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory **->** /attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory\r\n2. //\\\\attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory **->** /attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory\r\n3. \\\\//\\\\attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory **->** /attacker.com/..%2f..%2f../anyexistingdirectory\r\n\r\nAnd according to these test cases there was no redirection issued from the server after implementing the fix.\r\n\r\n<!-- issue-number: [bpo-43223](https://bugs.python.org/issue43223) -->\r\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue43223\r\n<!-- /issue-number -->\r\n",
