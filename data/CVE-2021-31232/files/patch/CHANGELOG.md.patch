+* [CHANGE] Fix for CVE-2021-31232: Local file disclosure vulnerability when `-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` is used. The HTTP basic auth `password_file` can be used as an attack vector to send any file content via a webhook. The alertmanager templates can be used as an attack vector to send any file content because the alertmanager can load any text file specified in the templates list. #4129
 * [CHANGE] Alertmanager now removes local files after Alertmanager is no longer running for removed or resharded user. #3910
 * [CHANGE] Alertmanager now stores local files in per-tenant folders. Files stored by Alertmanager previously are migrated to new hierarchy. Support for this migration will be removed in Cortex 1.11. #3910
 * [CHANGE] Ruler: deprecated `-ruler.storage.*` CLI flags (and their respective YAML config options) in favour of `-ruler-storage.*`. The deprecated config will be removed in Cortex 1.11. #3945
