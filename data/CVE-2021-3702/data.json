    "body": "Looking through the code, I found two separate race conditions with tempfile handling which can be exploited.  One of those is mentioned in #738. The other one happens because we create a tempdir and then delete it, then later reuse its name. An attacker can pre-create the tempdir in between the deletion and the second creation with the reused name.  This PR attempts to fix both.\r\n\r\nFixes #738",
