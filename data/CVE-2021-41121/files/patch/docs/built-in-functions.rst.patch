     Once this function has seen more use we provisionally plan to put it into the ``ethereum.abi`` namespace.
 
     * ``*args``: Arbitrary arguments
-    * ``ensure_tuple``: If set to True, ensures that even a single argument is encoded as a tuple. In other words, ``bytes`` gets encoded as ``(bytes,)``. This is the calling convention for Vyper and Solidity functions. Except for very specific use cases, this should be set to True. Must be a literal.

     * ``method_id``: A literal hex or Bytes[4] value to append to the beginning of the abi-encoded bytestring.
 
     Returns a bytestring whose max length is determined by the arguments. For example, encoding a ``Bytes[32]`` results in a ``Bytes[64]`` (first word is the length of the bytestring variable).
