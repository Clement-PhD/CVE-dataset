 XXXX-XX-XX -- X.X.X
 
+  * Fixed: Fix a bug affecting both uriNormalizeSyntax* and uriMakeOwner*
+      functions where the text range in .hostText would not be duped using
+      malloc but remain unchanged (and hence "not owned") for URIs with
+      an IPv4 or IPv6 address hostname (GitHub #121)
+  * Fixed: Fix the same bug in uriFreeUriMembers* functions that would not
+      free .hostText memory for URIs with an IPv4 or IPv6 address host;
+      also, calling uriFreeUriMembers* multiple times on a URI of this
+      very nature would result in trying to free pointers to stack
+      (rather than heap) memory (GitHub #121)
+  * Fixed: Fix functions uriNormalizeSyntax* for out-of-memory situations
+      (i.e. malloc returning NULL) for URIs containing empty segments
+      (any of user info, host text, query, or fragment) where previously
+      pointers to stack (rather than heap) memory were freed (GitHub #122)
   * Fixed: CMake: Call "enable_language(CXX)" prior to tinkering with
       CMAKE_CXX_* variables (GitHub #110)
       Thanks to Alexander Richardson for the patch (originally at libexpat)
