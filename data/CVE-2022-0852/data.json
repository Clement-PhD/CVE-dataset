    "body": "Passing values on the command line is insecure.  With this change,\r\nthe rhsm password is passed interactively to subscription-manager\r\ninstead of being passed on the commandline when we shell out to it.\r\n\r\nThe structure of this change deserves a bit of description.  Previously,\r\nwe called one function to assemble all of the information needed to\r\ninvoke subscription-manager and then returned that as a string that\r\ncould be run as a command line.  We called a second function with that\r\nstring to actually run the command.\r\n\r\nTo send the password interactively, we need to stop adding the password\r\nto the string of command line arguments but it still makes sense to keep\r\nthe code that figures out the password together with the code which\r\nfinds the other command line args.  So it makes sense to keep a single\r\nfunction to do that but return the password and other args separately.\r\n\r\nWe could use a dict, a class, or a tuple as the return value from the\r\nfunction.  That doesn't feel too ugly.  But then we need to pass that\r\nstructure into the function which takes care of invoking\r\nsubscription-manager on the command line and that *does* feel ugly.\r\nThat function would have to care about the structure of the data we pass\r\nin (If a tuple, what is the order?  If a dict, what are the field\r\nnames?, etc).  To take care of this, we can make the data structure that\r\nwe return from assembling the data a class and the function which calls\r\nsubscription-manager a method of that class because it's quite natural\r\nfor a method to have knowledge of what attributes the class contains.\r\n\r\nHmm... but now that we have a class with behaviours (methods), it starts\r\nto feel like we could do some more things.  A function that fills in the\r\nvalues of a class, validates that the data is proper, and then returns\r\nan instance of that class is really a constructor, right?  So it makes\r\nsense to move the function which assembles the data and returns the\r\nclass a constructor.  But that particular function isn't very generic:\r\nit uses knowledge of our global toolopts.tool_opts to populate the\r\nclass.  So let's write a simple __init__() that takes all of the values\r\nneeded as separate parameters and then create an alternative constructor\r\n(an @classmethod which returns an instance of the class) which gets the\r\ndata from a ToolOpt, and then calls __init__() with those values and\r\nreturns the resulting class.\r\n\r\nOkay, things are much cleaner now, but there's one more thing that we\r\ncan do.  We now have a class that has a constructor to read in data and\r\na single method that we can call to return some results.  What do we\r\ncall an object that can be called to return a result?  A function or\r\nmore generically, in python, a Callable.  We can turn this class into a\r\ncallable by renaming the method which actually invokes\r\nsubscription-manager __call__().\r\n\r\nWhat we have at the end of all this is a way to create a function which\r\nknows about the settings in tool_opts which we can then call to perform\r\nour subscription-manager needs::\r\n\r\n    registration_command = RegistrationCommand.from_tool_opts()\r\n    return_code = registration_command()\r\n\r\nOAMG-6551 #done  convert2rhel now passes the rhsm password to subscription-manager securely.\r\n\r\n* Modify the hiding of secret to hide both --password SECRET and\r\n  --password=SECRET.  Currently we only use it with passwords that we\r\n  are passing in the second form (to subscription-manager) but catching\r\n  both will future proof us in case we use this function for more things\r\n  in the future. (Eric Gustavsson)\r\n  * Note: using generator expressions was tried here but found that they\r\n    only bind the variable being iterated over at definition time, the\r\n    rest of the variables are bound when the generator is used.  This\r\n    means that constructing a set of generators in a loop doesn't really\r\n    work as the loop variables that you use in the generator will have a\r\n    different value by the time you're done.\r\n\r\n    So a nested for loop and if-else is the way to implement this.\r\n\r\n* Add a comment about activation_key being insecure for now.  We can fix\r\n  this once subscription-manager implements https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ENT-4724\r\n  (Eric Gustavsson)\r\n\r\nUnittest enhancements for the subscription RegisterCommand change:\r\n\r\n* Add global_tool_opts fixture to conftest.py which monkeypatches a\r\n  fresh ToolOpts into convert2rhel.toolopts.tool_opts.  That way tests\r\n  can modify that without worrying about polluting other tests.\r\n\r\n  * How toolopts is imported in the code makes a difference whether this\r\n    fixture is sufficient or if you need to do a little more work. If\r\n    the import is::\r\n\r\n      from convert2rhel import toolopts\r\n      do_something(toolopts.tool_opts.username)\r\n\r\n   then your test can just do::\r\n\r\n      def test_thing_that_uses_toolopts(global_tool_opts):\r\n          global_tool_opts.username = 'badger'\r\n\r\n   Most of our code, though, imports like this::\r\n\r\n      # In subscription.py, for instance\r\n      from convert2rhel.toolopts import tool_opts\r\n      do_something(tool_opts.username)\r\n\r\n   so the tests should do something like this::\r\n\r\n      def test_toolopts_differently(global_test_opts, monkeypatch):\r\n          monkeypatch.setattr(subscription, 'tool_opts', global_tool_opts)\r\n\r\n* Add unittests for utils.run_cmd_in_pty()\r\n* Add unittests for the subscription.RegistrationCommand object.\r\n* subscription_test.py::test_hide_secrets was expanded to test without\r\n  equals sign\r\n* Flaky test appeared within systeminfo_test.py::test_generate_rpm_va\r\n  due to changes to tool_opts in other tests. A temporary fix is added\r\n  until the whole test class is changed from unittest to pytest\r\n* Fix failing unittests for RegistrationCommand\r\n\r\n* Sometimes a process will close stdout before it is done processing.\r\n  When that happens, we need to wait() for the process to end before\r\n  closing the pty.  If we don't wait, the process will receive a HUP\r\n  signal which may end it before it is done.\r\n  * But on RHEL7, pexpect.wait() will throw an exception if you wait on\r\n    an already finished process.  So we need to ignore that exception\r\n    there.\r\n\r\n* Add integration test Check for cve fixes, add 'psutil' to\r\n  install-testing-depends playbook\r\n\r\n* Fix Pexpect.spawn truncating lines on RHEL7.\r\n  Along with a comment on why the change fixes the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELC-432",
