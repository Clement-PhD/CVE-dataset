    "body": "### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nWe currently have a function that is hooked into the `wp_handle_upload_prefilter` filter. In there we check if the file type is `image/svg+xml` and if so, we sanitize the file. If that sanitization process fails, we don't allow the file to be uploaded to WordPress.\r\n\r\nThere's a potential issue here though because the file type we rely on comes from the `Content-Type` of the original `form-data` request. Typically this will be automatically set to whatever the real file type is but in theory, someone could spoof this request and set `Content-Type` to be anything, like `image/png`. In this case, they could send an actual SVG in the `form-data` but set the `Content-Type` to be `image/png`, which would then bypass our sanitization process (but would still be uploaded to WordPress).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by utilizing the core WordPress function `wp_check_filetype_and_ext` to get the file type, instead of relying on the value that comes from the request. This should still work in all legitimate cases and if someone were to try sending a proper SVG but they change the `Content-Type` in the request, it will also catch that.\r\n\r\nI tested the following scenarios:\r\n- Valid SVG uploaded without a custom `Content-Type` set. **Our sanitization kicks in** \u2705 \r\n- Valid SVG uploaded with a custom `Content-Type` set (set to `image/png`). **Our sanitization kicks in** \u2705 \r\n- Valid PNG uploaded without a custom `Content-Type` set. **No sanitization needed from us** \u2705 \r\n- SVG file with a .png extension uploaded without a custom `Content-Type` set. **File rejected** \u2705 \r\n- SVG file with a .png extension uploaded with a custom `Content-Type` set. **File rejected** \u2705 \r\n- SVG file with no extension uploaded without a custom `Content-Type` set. **File rejected** \u2705 \r\n- SVG file with no extension uploaded with a custom `Content-Type` set. **File rejected** \u2705 \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nSlight impact on performance but should be minimal\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\nEnsure that you can still properly upload SVGs in WordPress.\r\n\r\nIf desired, can also manually make a `curl` request to send an SVG with a manipulated `Content-Type` field, to verify that captures things correctly. I can provide an example `curl` command if needed.\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have read the [**CONTRIBUTING**](/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n- [ ] My change requires a change to the documentation.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my change.\r\n- [ ] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n\r\n### Changelog Entry\r\n\r\n> Fixed - add better file type checking when looking for SVG files",
