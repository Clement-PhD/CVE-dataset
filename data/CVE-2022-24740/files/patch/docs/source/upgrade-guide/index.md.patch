+### Updated react-cookie library
+
+This fixes a use case where cookies could potentially be messed up if your site is under heavy load.
+The old `react-cookie` library was not able to handle correctly the SSR part, specially the one that
+is shared in "Nobody's land" (not SSR, not under the React tree, actions, Redux middleware).
+Upgrading to the latest version of the `react-cookie` suite (`react-cookie`, `universal-cookie-express` and `universal-cookie`) will fix it.
+
+You have to take action only in case you did some development involving cookies. The `react-cookie`
+library has been updated to the latest version and its companion libraries
+(`universal-cookie-express` and `universal-cookie`), and the API changed over the years. Please look into the documentation of these packages to get a grasp on the changes:
