    "body": "This PR introduces a new query that searches for reflected XSS email injections. This query specifically looks for vulnerabilities that utilize any one of these major Python email libraries:\r\n\r\n- [Django's Core Mail Library](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/email/)\r\n- [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/)\r\n- [FlaskMail](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/)\r\n- [SmtpLib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)\r\n\r\nThe most common scenario this query looks for is a Python application that utilizes an email library to deliver emails. The Python application passes user input into an email's HTML body, which can result in a reflective XSS attack on the email recipient. \r\n\r\nPS: Please note that both @mrthankyou and @jorgectf wrote this query. If accepted as a bug bounty we would like a 100% of the reward to go to @jorgectf. This will be re-iterated in the bug bounty submission.",
