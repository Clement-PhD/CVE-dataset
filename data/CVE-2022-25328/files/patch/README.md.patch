+* "allow\_cross\_user\_metadata" specifies whether `fscrypt` will allow
+  protectors and policies from other non-root users to be read, e.g. to be
+  offered as options by `fscrypt encrypt`.  The default value is `false`, since
+  other users might be untrusted and could create malicious files.  This can be
+  set to `true` to restore the old behavior on systems where `fscrypt` metadata
+  needs to be shared between multiple users.  Note that this option is
+  independent from the permissions on the metadata files themselves, which are
+  set to 0600 by default; users who wish to share their metadata files with
+  other users would also need to explicitly change their mode to 0644.
+
+## Setting up `fscrypt` on a filesystem
+
+`fscrypt` needs some directories to exist on the filesystem on which encryption
+will be used:
+
+* `MOUNTPOINT/.fscrypt/policies`
+* `MOUNTPOINT/.fscrypt/protectors`
+
+(If login protectors are used, these must also exist on the root filesystem.)
+
+To create these directories, run `fscrypt setup MOUNTPOINT`.  If MOUNTPOINT is
+owned by root, as is usually the case, then this command will require root.
+
+There will be one decision you'll need to make: whether non-root users will be
+allowed to create `fscrypt` metadata (policies and protectors).
+
+If you say `y`, then these directories will be made world-writable, with the
+sticky bit set so that users can't delete each other's files -- just like
+`/tmp`.  If you say `N`, then these directories will be writable only by root.
+
+Saying `y` maximizes the usability of `fscrypt`, and on most systems it's fine
+to say `y`.  However, on some systems this may be inappropriate, as it will
+allow malicious users to fill the entire filesystem unless filesystem quotas
+have been configured -- similar to problems that have historically existed with
+other world-writable directories, e.g. `/tmp`.  If you are concerned about this,
+say `N`.  If you say `N`, then you'll only be able to run `fscrypt` as root to
+set up encryption on users' behalf, unless you manually set custom permissions
+on the metadata directories to grant write access to specific users or groups.
+
+If you chose the wrong mode at `fscrypt setup` time, you can change the
+directory permissions at any time.  To enable single-user writable mode, run:
+
+    sudo chmod 0755 MOUNTPOINT/.fscrypt/*
+
+To enable world-writable mode, run:
+
+    sudo chmod 1777 MOUNTPOINT/.fscrypt/*
+
