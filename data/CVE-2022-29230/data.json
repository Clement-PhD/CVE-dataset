    "body": "NPM >= 7 installs peerDependencies by default except if they are marked as optional ([according to this](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/224)). Since we don't need certain dependencies in the `init` command and they are already included in the templates, we can stop installing them at the beginning when `npm create @shopify/hydrogen` is called, and install them in the background later together with all the other app deps.\r\n\r\n`@remix-run/dev` alone is [~119MB](https://pkg-size.dev/@remix-run/dev) so this should hopefully speed up installation times.\r\n\r\nThe best way to test this will be when it's merged by using `npm create @shopify/hydrogen@next`. However, you can also test locally by renaming `node_modules/@remix-run/dev` to a different name and running `h2 init` (or other commands to see the error).",
