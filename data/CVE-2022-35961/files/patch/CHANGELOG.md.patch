+ * `ECDSA`: `recover(bytes32,bytes)` and `tryRecover(bytes32,bytes)` no longer accept compact signatures to prevent malleability. Compact signature support remains available using `recover(bytes32,bytes32,bytes32)` and `tryRecover(bytes32,bytes32,bytes32)`.

 ## 4.7.2
 
  * `LibArbitrumL2`, `CrossChainEnabledArbitrumL2`: Fixed detection of cross-chain calls for EOAs. Previously, calls from EOAs would be classified as cross-chain calls. ([#3578](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3578))
