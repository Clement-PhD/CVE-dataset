This patch allows avoiding the worst-case scenario, but further investigation into using this lib with HTTP clients is recommended.\r\n\r\n<!-- Put an x inside [ ] to check it, like so: [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR fixes an issue.\r\n- [ ] This PR adds something new (e.g. new method or parameters).\r\n- [ ] This PR is a breaking change (e.g. methods or parameters removed/renamed).\r\n- [ ] This PR is **not** a code change (e.g. documentation, README, typehinting, examples, ...).\r\n",
