    "body": "If a user fails to set NODE_ENV=production, our built-in security checks are disabled and it's possible to misconfigure GrowthBook and leave the file upload API endpoint open to attack.\r\n\r\nTo be affected, ALL of the following must be true\r\n1. Self-hosted (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected)\r\n2. GrowthBook API exposed to the internet\r\n3. Using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage)\r\n4. NODE_ENV set to a non-production value\r\n5. JWT_SECRET set to the default \"dev\" string\r\n\r\nTo solve these security vulnerabilities, this PR makes 3 changes:\r\n1. Add more protection around the fileUpload API endpoint (protect against directory traversal, etc.)\r\n2. Only disable built-in security checks if the domain is still `localhost` (in case someone forgets to update NODE_ENV)\r\n3. Add an extra sanity check to the first-time register API endpoint\r\n\r\nWhat should you do if you are potentially affected:\r\n- **Update to the latest GrowthBook version**\r\n- Make sure `NODE_ENV` is set to \"production\"\r\n- Set the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string",
