    "body": "This patch randomizes the hash parameters for HTTP request and response classes per session. This avoids HashDoS attacks while not causing tremendous performance overhead.\r\n\r\nOther approaches we considered includes\r\n\r\n* `map` instead of `unordered_map`\r\n* `unordered_map<map<string, string>>`\r\n* cryptographically secure hashes for key\r\n* etc..\r\n\r\nBut all methods above causes more performance loss then this. We will be making a new release very soon after this PR being merged in order for our users to avoid the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAlso, this introduces an API break as the return type of `parameters()` is no longer `std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>()`. However in our survey (of the projects that the maintainers run). That API is rarely used and can be easily updated by using `auto` or updating the return type. \r\n\r\nWe'd like to attribute @itrofimow for discovering the issue",
