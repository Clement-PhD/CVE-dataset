I am not sure if this project is still maintained any more but it is still listed as a dependency by some other popular projects, so it would be good to patch.\r\n\r\nThe regex http.cookiejar.LOOSE_HTTP_DATE_RE was vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS). The regex contained multiple overlapping \\s* capture groups. A long sequence of spaces can trigger bad performance.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17157 and https://pyup.io/posts/pyup-discovers-redos-vulnerabilities-in-top-python-packages/",
