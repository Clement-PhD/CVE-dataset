+### Breaking changes
+
+* Default vault endpoint TLS certificate verification for `bf build` and `bf deploy` may fail in some environments. Use `-vev`/`--vault-endpoint-verify` option to disable or provide path to custom trusted certificates or CA certificates. Disabling makes execution vulnerable for MITM attacks and is discouraged - do it only when justified and in trusted environments. See [https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification) for details.
