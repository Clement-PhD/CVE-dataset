    "body": "## Background\r\n\r\nAudit logging is an enterprise feature with an option for encryption using AES.  An AES cipher has three ingredients: a private key, an iv (or nonce), and plaintext.  The nonce is public but it must be unique.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently we use a [16]byte nonce.  The first 12 bytes come from a baseIv which is initialized when an audit log is created.  The last 4 bytes come from the length of the log line being encrypted.  This is problematic because two log lines will often have the same length, so due to these collisions we are reusing the same nonce many times.  AES requires a unique nonce and without a unique nonce it is trivial to break.  Many thanks to @HakuPiku for pointing this out to us.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nUse crypto/rand to generate a unique nonce every time we encrypt a log line.  Previously we used what was essentially a 16 byte header (12 byte baseIv and 4 byte length of line).  We now use a [20] byte header, consisting of a unique nonce (16 bytes) and length of line (4 bytes).\r\n\r\n## Remarks\r\n\r\n- For audit logging, _x/log_writer.go_ controls all the audit logging (i.e., writing) while  _ee/audit/run_ee.go_ does all the decrypting.  There are other encryption/decryption tools (in testutil, e.g.) that are used for other purposes (e.g., exports).\r\n- Customers may have old audit logs that will have to be decrypted using the deprecated method.  Now the decrypt method will determine whether the audit log is old or new and use the appropriate scheme.\r\n- This PR also adds several integration tests to check if we can appropriately encrypt and decrypt audit logs (previously we had no integration tests for this, only a small unit test)\r\n- We also add tests to check if an audit log in the old format can be decrypted correctly.  This is the reason there is an `.enc` file checked into the PR.\r\n- Finally we add an extra unit test to verify that encrypted audit logs can be truncated and still decrypted successfully (up to the line that was truncated)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation\r\n- https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/cipher#example-NewCTR",
