    "body": "Please read https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-flow.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `LeaseTimeToLive()` API or `etcdctl lease timetolive` command don't require RBAC permission. However, their responses can have key names attached to the target lease. Value of the keys cannot be accessed through the API, but protecting the key name is better. So this PR let the API require read permission of keys attached to a lease (if a lease isn't attached to specific keys, behavior won't be changed).\r\n\r\ncc @ahrtr @serathius @spzala @ptabor ",
