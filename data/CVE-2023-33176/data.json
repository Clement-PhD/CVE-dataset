    "body": "### What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a check to validate the presentation URL passed by presentation upload to ensure that it is not malicious and to protect against potential vulnerabilities from not validating the URL. Also adds two new properties to `bigbluebutton.properties` called `insertDocumentSupportedProtocols` and `insertDocumentBlockedHosts`. The `insertDocumentSupportedProtocols` property defines what protocols, such as HTTPS, are supported for presentation download URLs. The `insertDocumentBlockedHosts` property allows an administrator to explicitly define what hosts a presentation cannot be downloaded from.\r\n\r\nThe URL passed from presentation upload is considered valid if:\r\n- It uses one of the supported protocols\r\n- It does not originate from a host that has been blocked\r\n- All addresses of the host are\r\n  - Valid\r\n  - Not local addresses\r\n  - Not loopback addresses\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nThe purpose of this URL validation is prevent potential vulnerabilities resulting from a URL that has not been validated being used in presentation download.",
