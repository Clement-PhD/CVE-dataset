Make sure that there is an accompanying issue to your PR.\r\n\r\n   Fixes SNOW-761004\r\n\r\n2. Fill out the following pre-review checklist:\r\n\r\n   - [x] I am adding a new automated test(s) to verify correctness of my new code\r\n   - [x] I am adding new logging messages\r\n   - [ ] I am adding a new telemetry message\r\n   - [ ] I am modifying authorization mechanisms\r\n   - [ ] I am adding new credentials\r\n   - [ ] I am modifying OCSP code\r\n   - [ ] I am adding a new dependency\r\n\r\n3. Please describe how your code solves the related issue.\r\n\r\n   Currently Python connector does not ensure the validity of the SSO URL and just opens it in the browser. The connector should ensure that the URL is a valid HTTP / HTTPS URL before passing it to the Browser. This PR also adds support for URL encoding strings. This will be used later for encoding Base64 OCSP requests before sending them to the OCSP Responder. ",
