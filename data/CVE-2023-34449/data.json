    "body": "Implements the Message related changes of #1207.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that every message now returns a `Result<Message::Output, LangError>`,\r\nwhere a `LangError` is a type of error which doesn't originate from the contract itself,\r\nnor from the underlying execution environment (so the Contracts pallet in this case).\r\n\r\nAn example of where this would arise is if a caller tries to use a non-existent message\r\nselector for a contract. Previously, the contract would trap and not allow the caller to\r\ndo any sort of error handling if it encountered a non-existent selector. \r\n\r\nThis breaks the ABI in two ways: first, all contract messages now have a `Result` return\r\ntype, and second a new field, `lang_err`, will be introduced as part of the contract\r\nspec. The second change allows other languages, such as Solang, to use an equivalent\r\n`LangError`.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>If you're curious, click here for a snippet of the new metadata for the Flipper contract.</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"messages\": [\r\n  {\r\n    \"args\": [],\r\n    \"docs\": [\r\n      \" Flips the current value of the Flipper's boolean.\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"label\": \"flip\",\r\n    \"mutates\": true,\r\n    \"payable\": false,\r\n    \"returnType\": {\r\n      \"displayName\": [\r\n        \"ink\",\r\n        \"MessageResult\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"type\": 1\r\n    },\r\n    \"selector\": \"0x633aa551\"\r\n  }],\r\n\"lang_error\": {\r\n  \"displayName\": [\r\n    \"ink\",\r\n    \"LangError\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"type\": 3\r\n},\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 3,\r\n  \"type\": {\r\n    \"def\": {\r\n      \"variant\": {\r\n        \"variants\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"index\": 1,\r\n            \"name\": \"CouldNotReadInput\"\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"path\": [\r\n      \"ink_primitives\",\r\n      \"LangError\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Add new `LangError` type to metadata\r\n- [x] Add E2E test for demonstrating how to handle `LangError`s\r\n- [x] Make CI green\r\n\r\nTODOs in Follow-Ups:\r\n- [ ] Implement changes for constructors (#1512)\r\n- [ ] Implement changes for traits (#1531)\r\n- [ ] Refactor dispatch logic to bubble up specific dispatch error\r\n    - Will happen at the expense of always having an extra error variant in `LangError`\r\n - [ ] Make the `CallBuilder` API not require an explicit `Result` (#1525)\r\n\r\ncc @xgreenx since you were the original poster for the issue",
