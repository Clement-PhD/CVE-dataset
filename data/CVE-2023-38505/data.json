    "body": "The old TLS implementation, aside from the fact that it was not taking full advantage of Rust's flexible type system, was horribly, horribly, flawed. The main reason is it could only handle attempting 1 TLS handshake at a time. This is fine if you're working with standard clients, but it also makes the dashboard incredibly easy to DDOS. There are 2 ways to fix this: allow handling multiple handshakes at once, or add a timeout for every handshake.\r\n\r\nI separated out the TLS implementation into its own crate, [flexible-hyper-server-tls](https://crates.io/crates/flexible-hyper-server-tls), basically completely rewrote it to make it more robust, and implemented both of the above fixes.\r\n\r\nJust to demonstrate the shortcomings of the old TLS system, I recorded some demos.\r\n\r\nOld: https://asciinema.org/a/8nRKbdf7AkPLmP3QxFZUSmPwp\r\nNew: https://asciinema.org/a/RYtJX6zUoOC44lMujKDv3ooUH\r\n\r\nI'll be publishing a hotfix release soon to address these issues.",
