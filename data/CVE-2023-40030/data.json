    "body": "This converts the feature name validation check from a warning to an error. This was added in #8814 in Rust 1.49 released in 2020-12-31 (about 2.5 years ago) with a warning that it will become a hard error in the future.\r\n\r\nThese extended characters aren't allowed on crates.io, so this should only impact users of other registries, or people who don't publish to a registry. The warning message requested anyone impacted by it to let us know. We got one report, and added support for . as result. Since there weren't any other reports, I think it should be pretty safe to move forward.\r\n\r\nThe diff here is a little large because it removes the pass-through of `config` since it isn't needed anymore.\r\nAdditionally, the tests were restructured since testing every edge case in an integration test has a lot of overhead. Instead, there is now a unit test which runs much faster, with the integration test just verifying that it fires and checks the two forms of error messages.\r\n\r\nCloses #8813",
