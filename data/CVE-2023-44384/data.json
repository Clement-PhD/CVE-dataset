After entering an issue key or an arbitrary path in the \u201cAttach Issue\u201d feature, the request failed, however, the output of the response was reflected in the error logs. This vulnerability could be used to enumerate ports on the remote host locally, as well as retrieve responses from non-public-facing services, such as the Prometheus Ruby Exporter. While the path to the issue lookup was automatically appended by the application, it was possible to use the \u201c\u2026/\u201d notation to manipulate the path from the interface. Therefore, any user with the ability to add an existing issue to a POST could perform arbitrary GET requests against the Jira API, however, only the administrator could see the output in the error logs.",
