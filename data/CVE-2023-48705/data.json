    "body": "# Closes: GHSA-cf9f-wmhp-v4pr (for 2.0.x)\r\n# What's Changed\r\n\r\n- Audit all uses of `mark_safe` in our code base and change to `format_html` where appropriate for security and integrity.\r\n  - This fixes several cases where `CustomLink`, `ComputedField`, and `JobButton` were provably vulnerable to XSS\r\n  - This also hardens a number of other cases that I wasn't able to trivially exploit but should be considered insecure as previously implemented.\r\n- Add test cases for CustomLink, ComputedField, and JobButton rendering. These are not exhaustive but provide at least some automated validation of the fixes and protection against regression.\r\n- As I originally discovered this issue by experimenting with using `ruff` for linting, I've added `ruff` to the invoke tasks and also to the CI (not yet validated).\r\n   - I've enabled a few basic categories of lint rules (mostly redundant with `flake8`, but inexpensive to cover with `ruff` as well and laying groundwork for eventually removing `flake8` less urgently)\r\n   - I've enabled the `S308` security rule that specifically flags usage of `mark_safe` (there are a lot of other rules in the S category that we should plan to enable and audit over time)\r\n   - I've added `# noqa: S308` to the remaining cases of `mark_safe` in our code that I believe to be in fact safe. *I'D STRONGLY APPRECIATE A SANITY CHECK ON ALL OF THESE!*\r\n\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n<!--\r\n    Please feel free to update todos to keep track of your own notes for WIP PRs.\r\n-->\r\n- [x] Explanation of Change(s)\r\n- [x] Added change log fragment(s) (for more information see [the documentation](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/development/#creating-changelog-fragments))\r\n- n/a Attached Screenshots, Payload Example\r\n- [x] Unit, Integration Tests\r\n- n/a Documentation Updates (when adding/changing features)\r\n- n/a Example Plugin Updates (when adding/changing features)\r\n- [x] Outline Remaining Work, Constraints from Design\r\n",
