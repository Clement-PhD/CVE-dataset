    "body": "There was a report that Vim was using heap-use-after free in a deeply recursive :substitute call chain.\r\n\r\nThe following commit will fix this. I haven't been able to create a reproducible test case yet unfortunately.\r\n\r\nUntil now, we used the sub variable mostly as a pointer to the stack, however, sometimes it was actually allocated, so in addition the variable sub_copy was used to remember if there was anything to free.\r\n\r\nHowever, when calling :s recursively, it may happen that sub points to the allocated variable old_sub, which might be freed later in a recursive call, which means that sub would then point to freed memory.\r\n\r\nSo let's just always allocate memory for sub but of course now we need to make sure to properly free the memory whenever we leave the function.\r\n\r\nSince sub is now always allocated, we don't need the sub_copy variable anymore, which makes it slightly more easier to read.\r\n\r\nTODO: add a proper test case that causes the initial issue.",
